  abstract   = {Sharing economy platforms have become extremely popular in the last few years, and they have changed the way in which we commute, travel, and borrow among many other activities. Despite their popularity among consumers, such companies are poorly regulated. For example, Airbnb, one of the most successful examples of sharing economy platform, is often criticized by regulators and policy makers. While, in theory, municipalities should regulate the emergence of Airbnb through evidence-based policy making, in practice, they engage in a false dichotomy: some municipalities allow the business without imposing any regulation, while others ban it altogether. That is because there is no evidence upon which to draft policies. Here we propose to gather evidence from the Web. After crawling Airbnb data for the entire city of London, we find out where and when Airbnb listings are offered and, by matching such listing information with census and hotel data, we determine the socioeconomic conditions of the areas that actually benefit from the hospitality platform. The reality is more nuanced than one would expect, and it has changed over the years. Airbnb demand and offering have changed over time, and traditional regulations have not been able to respond to those changes. That is why, finally, we rely on our data analysis to envision regulations that are responsive to real-time demands, contributing to the emerging idea of "algorithmic regulation".},

Unlike the histogram, the kernel technique produces smooth estimate of the pdf, uses all sample points' locations and more convincingly suggest multimodality. In its two-dimensional applications, kernel estimation is even better as the 2D histogram requires additionally to define the orientation of 2D bins. Two concepts play fundamental role in kernel estimation: kernel function shape and coefficient of smoothness, of which the latter is crucial to the method. Several real-life examples, both for univariate and bivariate applications, are shown.},

  year     = {2013},
  month    = {12},
  abstract = {Peer-to-peer markets, collectively known as the sharing economy, have emerged as alternative suppliers of goods and services traditionally provided by long-established industries. We explore the economic impact of the sharing economy on incumbent rms by studying the case of Airbnb, a prominent platform for short-term accommodations. We analyze Airbnb's entry into the state of Texas, and quantify its impact on the Texas hotel industry over the subsequent decade. We estimate that in Austin, where Airbnb supply is highest, the causal impact on hotel revenue is in the 8-10% range; moreover, the impact is non-uniform, with lower-priced hotels and those hotels not catering to business travelers being the most aected. The impact manifests itself primarily through less aggressive hotel room pricing, an impact that benets all consumers, not just participants in the sharing economy. The price response is especially pronounced during periods of peak demand, such as SXSW, and is due to a dierentiating feature of peer-to-peer platforms enabling instantaneous supply to scale to meet demand. * The authors thank the participants and organizers of SCECR '13, WISE '13, Platform Strategy '14, ACM EC '15 and the seminar participants at Telefonica I+D Research Barcelona, Technicolor Research Paris, Simon Business School, and Microsoft Research New England for their helpful feedback.

  abstract  = {In 2009 Ginsberg et al. reported using Google search query volume to estimate influenza activity in advance of traditional methodologies. It was a groundbreaking example of digital disease detection, and it still remains illustrative of the power of gathering data from the internet for important research. In recent years, the methodologies have been extended to include new topics and data sources; Twitter in particular has been used for surveillance of influenza-like-illnesses, political sentiments, and even behavioral risk factors like sentiments about childhood vaccination programs. As the research landscape continuously changes, the protection of human subjects in online research needs to keep pace. Here we propose a number of guidelines for ensuring that the work done by digital researchers is supported by ethical-use principles. Our proposed guidelines include: 1) Study designs using Twitter-derived data should be transparent and readily available to the public. 2) The context in which a tweet is sent should be respected by researchers. 3) All data that could be used to identify tweet authors, including geolocations, should be secured. 4) No information collected from Twitter should be used to procure more data about tweet authors from other sources. 5) Study designs that require data collection from a few individuals rather than aggregate analysis require Institutional Review Board (IRB) approval. 6) Researchers should adhere to a user's attempt to control his or her data by respecting privacy settings. As researchers, we believe that a discourse within the research community is needed to ensure protection of research subjects. These guidelines are offered to help start this discourse and to lay the foundations for the ethical use of Twitter data.},

Airbnb, which is one of the largest and best-known platforms, provides the focus for this paper and offers a service that allows users to rent properties or spare rooms to guests. Its rapid growth has led to a growing discourse around the consequences of Airbnb rentals within the local context. The research within this paper focuses on determining impact on local housing prices within the inner London boroughs by constructing a longitudinal panel dataset, on which a fixed and random effects regression was conducted. The results indicate that there is a significant and modest positive association between the frequency of Airbnb and the house price per square metre in these boroughs.},

  abstract  = {To publish ethical research, most researchers immediately think of the process of writing a manuscript, plagiarism issues, and providing authorship and credit to those who contributed. Publishing ethical research is much more, however, than the end product of a study or the aspect of writing up one's results. Not only does it include the actual written manuscript, final results, and authorship credit, but it also entails decisions made during the entire research process. Ethical research, in general, should contribute to the knowledge base of the profession (American Counseling Association [ACA], 2005), respect and inform research participants, minimize risks to participants, use appropriate methodological procedures and data analysis to answer the research question, and appropriately recognize contributors. Ultimately, ethical research requires a researcher to engage in the responsible conduct of research. The responsible conduct of research is defined as "conducting research in ways that fulfill the professional responsibilities of researchers, as defined by their professional organization, the institutions for which they work, and when relevant, the government and public" (Steneck, 2006, p. 55). The 2005 ACA Code of Ethics provides guidelines regarding ethical issues in research (ACA, 2005, Section G). When engaging in research, a researcher should follow the ethical guidelines of ACA and other organizations with which he or she is affiliated to ensure research integrity and, consequently, the publication of ethical research. Thus, publishing ethical research entails engaging in the responsible conduct of research, as well as ensuring conclusion validity in quantitative research and confirmability in qualitative research. Conclusion validity refers to the degree to which the findings and conclusions of a study are correct or accurate. Conclusion validity is not typically discussed, and when it is, it is usually discussed only in relation to quantitative research as statistical conclusion validity (e.g., Heppner, Wampold, & Kivlighan, 2008). In qualitative research, researchers discuss the level to which the results make sense, or can be confirmed or corroborated by others, as confirmability (Sharts-Hopko, 2002). For both quantitative and qualitative research, various aspects of a study create threats to conclusion validity and/ or confirmability, including the research question(s), sample, procedures for data collection and data analysis (e.g., "fishing},

  abstract  = {T he massive amount of sensitive survey data about individuals that agencies collect and share through the Internet is causing a great deal of privacy concerns. These concerns may discourage individuals from revealing their sensitive information. Existing data collection techniques have serious downsides in terms of both efficiency and the levels of protection they offer against various realizations of threats. Moreover, they do not provide any flexibility to the users to be able to specify acceptable levels of privacy protection before deciding whether to participate in the surveys. In this paper, we propose a two-pronged privacy protection model corresponding to these two privacy concerns: these are a new efficient anonymity preserving data collection technique and a method to incorporate heterogeneous privacy constraints. Together, they help preserve the privacy of respondents both during and after data collection.},
